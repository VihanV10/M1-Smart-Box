What is the M1 Smart Box?


The journey from warehouse to doorstep is fraught with hazards for delicate items. Collisions, mishandling, and environmental variables pose constant threats, often resulting in undetected damage until the moment of unboxing. Consequently, customers are left grappling with the inconvenience of returns, replacements, or refunds, disrupting the seamless experience promised by online shopping.
In response to this pressing concern, the M1 Smart Box emerges as a beacon of innovation, poised to revolutionize the landscape of delivery management. Conceived as a solution to the inherent flaws of traditional delivery systems, this groundbreaking product embodies the convergence of cutting-edge technology and logistical ingenuity.
At its core, the M1 Smart Box harnesses advanced pressure sensing technology, bolstered by materials such as Velostat, to provide real-time monitoring of transported goods. Equipped with gyroscopic sensors and sophisticated algorithms, it continuously analyzes the physical state of its contents throughout the journey. Any deviations from the norm trigger instant alerts that are recieved directly in the inbox of thr user/company, empowering both users and delivery companies with timely insights into the condition of the package.

How it Works:

The M1 Smart Box uses a combination of one ESP32 Wi-fi Module and one Arduino Mega as the basis for its hardware. The Arduino Mega is connected to a combination of a 6-axis gyrometer, which is used to detect changes in the rotation of the box, and a set of six pressure-sensing Velostat strips, which are used to detect impacts on the sides of the boxâ€™s interior from the product being jolted, jostled, or falling over. The ESP32 is connected to the Arduino Mega, to allow the two boards to communicate with each other through serial communication. They are connected via the RX2/TX2 ports; pins 16 and 17 on the Arduino Mega and TX2 and RX2 on the ESP32. The Velostat strips are lined along the interior of the box, one on each side. There is a compartment where the ESP32 and the Arduino Mega, as well as the gyrometer, is stored, separately from the product. The Arduino Mega is configured to read inputs from 6 square-shaped Velostat strips as well as the gyrometer. The gyrometer reads and stores the changes in the rotation of the box, and the Velostat strips read the force applied through a sudden impact or fall of the product impacting the Velostat and causing it to crumple.
The software loaded onto the Arduino Mega consists of reading inputs from a sensor and assigning them to variables, which are then monitored and used in the calculation of the damage report. To do this, the Arduino Mega uses its analog pins to read inputs from the gyrometer and Velostat. The gyrometer measures changes in rotation, so its input is set to continuously read and trigger a message send through the Serial Monitor if the change in rotation exceeds 2.0 radians per second. In practice, this means that if the box if rotated at a certain speed or above, it will detect damage. The reading of the Velostat, on the other hand, is based off of the voltage that runs through it. It begins at a value between 300 and 400, so a global variable is used to store its initial value for accuracy. Based off of the deviation from this standard value, should the difference between the read value and the initial value be greater than 30, the box will trigger a damage detection.
The ESP32 Wi-Fi Module then takes this input from the Arduino Mega through Serial Communication via a Serial Monitor provided by a computer connection, sending an email to a target user through a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, a specialized cloud server that is used to send emails. SMTP works by transmitting an email template to an SMTP server, usually an electronic mail client, which then uses the template to generate an email and pass it on to another user.
